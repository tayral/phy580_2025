    "The goal of this project is to understand how to compute the ground state energy of a hydrogen molecule using a \"noisy\" quantum computer, namely a quantum computer with physical errors. We are going to learn about two main methods to perform this task by following a recent study by O'Malley et al from the Google Quantum AI team, published in the Physical Review X journal. The paper can be downloaded from arXiv at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06860 (but you should have received a printed version of it).\n",

You will in particular be able to rewrite the quantum circuits used by the scientists and run perfect and noisy simulations of the quantum algorithms described in the paper.

    "- **Group 1**: Variational Quantum Eigensolving (VQE), with a deeper focus on hardware noise\n",
    "- **Group 2**: Variational Quantum Eigensolving (VQE), with an extension to an error mitigation method\n",

    "- **All the students in the group should have a more or less equal speaking time during the presentation.**\n",

    "- Equations should be kept to a minimum (but sometimes showing one equation is simpler than a long explanation!)\n",
    "- Not more than 1 slide per minute!\n",

We can try to reduce (or \"mitigate\") the effects of noise with a trick introduced in this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03897 (p4). The method is simple: given a noisy QPU with noise level \"$r$\" ($r > 0$ if the computer is not perfect), one can try to artificially increase the noise strength $r$ to get the VQE energy $E(r)$, and then extrapolate to the $r\\rightarrow 0$ limit. \n",

In the perfect case, a pair of CNOT gates is an identity gate. In the noisy case, it approximately boils down to adding a noise of strength $2\\epsilon$ (if we suppose that one CNOT gate incurs a noise of strength $\\epsilon$). Thus, a CNOT gate in the initial circuit (strength $r=\\epsilon$) is replaced by $1+2m$ CNOT gates, corresponding to a noise strength $r=(1+2m)\\epsilon$. If we record the value of the VQE energy $E(m)$, the \"noiseless\" ($r=0$) extrapolation is $E(m=-1/2)$.\n",
