# Tutorials for PHY 580

## Requirements

You can either use Google Colab to run the notebook (recommended for today's tutorial):

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tayral/su_m2_iq/)

... or myBinder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tayral/su_m2_iq/HEAD)

... or you need to have myqlm installed on your computer (to continue at home):

	pip install myqlm
	pip install myqlm-simulators



## Howto

If you used the first two methods (Google Colab/myBinder): click on "dihydrogen-project.ipynb".

If you used the second method (laptop install):

- launch a jupyter kernel:

	jupyter notebook

- then, open the notebook "dihydrogen-project.ipynb".
